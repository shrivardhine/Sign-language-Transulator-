Sign Language Translator

This project implements a deep learning model to detect and translate sign language gestures into text. The project is built using TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential libraries. The model is trained on a dataset of sign language images and can predict the corresponding class label with a certain level of confidence.

Introduction

This project aims to create a system that can recognize and translate sign language gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a labeled dataset of sign language images and can predict the sign with high accuracy.
